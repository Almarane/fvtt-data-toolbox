# Data Toolbox - Let's Contribute

*Let's Contribute*, which is part of the Data Toolbox, provides a set of tools 
and interfaces which help the community contribute and improve compendiums.

_Note: this part of the module is under development (not yet officially available)_

## Typical use case

* A **player** (anyone) imports a few entries from the spell compendium on his character sheet
* He/she notices that the spells don't have the associated actions
* He/she adds an attack and improves the entry
* After successfully testing it, he/she can contribute it back to the community
* The **designed reviewers** can now see the newly submitted contribution. They can:
  * Compare it with the original entry and see the changes
  * Import it into the Items' directory to test it
  * Mark it as 'accepted' or 'rejected'
  * Simply delete it
* Finally, the **maintainers** of the system can import and merge all 'accepted' contributions to the compendium and make them available to everyone
