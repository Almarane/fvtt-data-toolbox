# Let's Contribute - User

This page presents how any user can submit contributions to improve compendiums.

*Go back to [Data Toolbox | Let's Contribute](README.md) for a global overview.*

## Submit an entry

The typical use case considers that:
* you created a new character
* you added some entries from existing compendiums (ex: race, ability, equipment, etc.)
* you improved some entries by fixing wrong or incomplete data

Then, you can contribute those improvements back to the community:
* On the top left corner of the window, you'll see a small upload icon
* Click on it to open the Submit dialog

* Check if there is an existing initiative from the community for that module/system. Initiatives help reviewers focus on some goals.
* Enter your nickname as *Author* if you want to identified. This can help during the review process.
* Then simply click on the button *I agree* to submit the entry
* Your contribution will eventually be accepted and merged back into the compendium, benefiting the entire community

## Troubleshooting

* If you don't see the upload icon, make sure that your entry is an "item". *(the module will eventually support other types in the future)*
* If you get the error message below, that means that the module/system has no reviewer yet. Contact the developer(s) of it on Discord in order to put a community in place for reviewing contributions.
